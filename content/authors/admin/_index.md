Hi! I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the[ University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au), advised by [Prof. Zhuo Jin](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/zhuo-jin), [Prof. Shuanming Li](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/99730-shuanming-li), and [Dr. Ping Chen](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profileprint/268179). Currently, I am also a visiting research student in the [Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science](https://saasweb.hku.hk) at the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk) working with [Prof. Hailiang Yang](https://saasweb.hku.hk/staff/hlyang/). Before moving to Melbourne, I obtained my master's degree from the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.berkeley.edu), [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu), and worked as a data engineer in Shanghai. Before coming to Berkeley, I received my Bachelor's degree with honours from [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au). My advisor was [Prof. Reiichiro Kawai](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/focus/en/people/k0001_03308.html). 

My research interests are stochastic optimal control, systemic risk, and numerical methods for control problems. My CV is available {{< staticref "uploads/mingqiu_CV.pdf" "newtab" >}}here{{< /staticref >}}.
