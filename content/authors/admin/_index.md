Hi! I am a third year Ph.D. student at the University of Melbourne, advised by Prof. Zhuo Jin, Prof. Shuanming Li, and Dr. Ping Chen. Currently, I am also a visiting research student at the University of Hong Kong working with Prof. Hailiang Yang. Before moving to Melbourne, I obtained my master's degree from Department of Statistics, UC Berkeley and worked as a data engineer in Shanghai. Before coming to Berkeley, I received my Bachelor's degree with honours from University of Sydney. My advisor was Prof. Reiichiro Kawai.
